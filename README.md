This is a collection of different ways to provide a course plan overview for the year. It's an update of an old application from a few years ago, but with different methods of displaying the data.
The old app just built lots of div blocks and it worked well, but I always wanted to try get a canvas version working which I had started back in the dimness of 2017.

As time has eroded almost all functionality of even the older working version, I need to poke through things and rattle a few functions.

This is an old prototype I made for the IT admin group, so they could see a quick overview of upcoming courses and any relevant details they might need, like passwords, interpretation, etc.
It was supposed to be for phones, so the IT guys could check things on the go, but for all the usual reasons I never finished it.
It should ideally be viewed as a phone app, so set the Responsive Design Mode to a phone view.

Thuis too was an old prototype. The original part of a larger desktop app that handled heaps of things. This part was to show an interactive detailed overview of a course year plan, with immediately accessible visuals to show different departments what they needed to know at a glance. There was the option to drill down into individual courses and print out requirement summaries and the usual things like that. It worked well in WPF and C#, but I wanted to try recreate things in javascript because I was bored and needed something to tickel my learning itch. This is the revenant of one of those. It's not really working yet (15-08-24) but I'll poke away until I'm satisfied.
