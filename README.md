This is a collection of different ways to provide a course plan overview for the year. It's an update of an old application from a few years ago, but with different methods of displaying the data.
The old app just built lots of div blocks and it worked well, but I always wanted to try get a canvas version working which I had started back in the dimness of 2017.

As time has eroded almost all functionality of even the older working version, I need to poke through things and rattle a few functions. I'm curious why various things have broken, but it's all gonna take a bit more time than I have today. Start again tomorrow (Aug 14)!
